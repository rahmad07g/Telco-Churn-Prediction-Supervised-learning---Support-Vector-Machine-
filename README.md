# Telco Churn Prediction (Supervised learning -  Support Vector Machine)
In this case I use 6 machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regresion, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors. The metric used in this case is ROC-AUC, because to make a good and balanced model in predicting customer churn or not.The best model in this case is -  Support Vector Machine. Libraries used by Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
